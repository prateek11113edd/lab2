Inheritance: Accuring the properties from parent class to the child class

 
public class student {


}

public class SmartStudent : student {

}

Encapsulation : the method and property working on the same data should be in same class

Polymorphism : it means manyb forms it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

public class run {

public void speed(){

console.writeline("Fast");
}
}

public class walk : run  {

public void speed(){

console.writeline("slow");
}
}
